# Difference between distance metric function and kernel function.

Distance metric function and kernel function can calculate similarity or distance between two items.

However, there is a little difference between them. In short, the distance metric function needs to hold more conditions than the kernel function does.

A related question can be found [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3311684/relationship-between-kernels-and-metrics), [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/221704/transforming-a-distance-function-to-a-kernel), and [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1862037/how-do-you-prove-triangle-inequality-for-this-metric).

Also, some papers aim to disentangle the relationship between them. To name a few, [Jakel et al., "Similarity, kernels, and the triangle inequality"](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.481.1549&rep=rep1&type=pdf) and [Jain et al., "Metric and Kernel Learning Using a Linear Transformation"](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~inderjit/public_papers/metric_kernel_learning_jmlr12.pdf).
